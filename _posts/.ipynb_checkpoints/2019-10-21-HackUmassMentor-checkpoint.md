title: "(PP) Hack Umass Mentor"

This past weekend I had the pleasure of being a mentor at Hack Umass. Going to Umass as an ECE student, I saw the development of this event from a small hardware-only hackathon to what it is now. Now every year, me and a few friends drive up to the event to see the cool hacks and reconnect. This year though was my first as being a mentor

#### What is a hackathon?  
Most reading this probably already know what a hackathon is but just in case I will reverberate it. Hackathons are events where people come together and compete in a fixed time interval to "hack" together a cool project! Hackathons can be themed or have some form of goal statement. Examples can include Healthcare, AI, Blockchain, or any buzzword of choice... or they can just be open ended (Hack Umass fits in this category). Its a great time, brainstorming, coding, food, stress, energy drinks and a lack of sleep. Its a haven.       


#### Hack Umass
I was a mentor. This just includes being available for groups that have questions or need any other form of help. The group of mentors included a diverse set of volunteers with skills spanning a variety of realms of hardware and software.  
Unfortunately there was over 850 participants and not nearly as many mentors. So sometimes you're left with groups requiring assistance in a domain you dont know much about. This is what I want to focus on.  
Over 50% of the questions I ended up with regarded microcontrollers. During my degree in computer engineering I was no stranger to working with microcontrollers but its been a while and it definitely was not my expertise. *So how can I help a group of students if I dont know the answer myself?*
