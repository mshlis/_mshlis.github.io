### Here is a blog for some cool projects / research ideas that I can do in my spare time

### [Project 1: ANNagram](https://mshlis.github.io/ANNagram/)
For my first project in this blog I write from scratch a pointer network with a transformer backbone. For smaller words its a silly idea, because exhaustive checking would be quick and perfectly accurate, but this grows in a combinatoric fashion. On the other hand a transformer-based encoder/decoder will grow quadratically with input length.
