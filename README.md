### Here is a blog for some cool projects / research ideas that I can do in my spare time

#### but before we get into this blog a little about me and this blogs motivation:
I graduated from Umass Amherst with a bachelors in Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics where I also completed REUs in a span of fields from logic debugging and eigensolvers all the way to analysis on hyperspectral imageing. Currently I work as a Machine Learning Researcher at Systems and Technology Research, a medium-sized defense contractor located in Woburn MA. In my free time, im usually working on some project to help me get a hands on perspective of the pros/cons of whatever model im replicating/extending. Because of this, a friend recently mentioned I should start a github blog and here I am :). I also sprinkle in some research focused ideas as well. The goal is to hopefully push a project atleast once every one or two weeks.

### [Project 1: ANNagram](https://mshlis.github.io/ANNagram/)
For my first project in this blog I write from scratch a pointer network with a transformer backbone. For smaller words its a silly idea, because exhaustive checking would be quick and perfectly accurate, but this grows in a combinatoric fashion. On the other hand a transformer-based encoder/decoder will grow quadratically with input length.
