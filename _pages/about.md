I graduated from UMass Amherst with a bachelors in Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics where I also completed REUs in a span of fields from logic debugging and eigensolvers all the way to computer vision techniqes within the domain of hyperspectral imageing. Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Researcher at Systems and Technology Research, a medium-sized defense contractor. There I am working on projects that include vision, language processing, and reinforcement learning. I enjoy working on small side projects in my free time and so a pal reccomended starting this up, so here I am.
